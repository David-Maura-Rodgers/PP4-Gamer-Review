### Edit and Delete Reviews (SAFETY FEATURE):
As mentioned above, it is important that that user who are logged can only see their own reviews from the Your Reviews, as this gives access to the edit and delete options.

In the case shown below, the user logged in is David. If I click on a post made in the home page made by Aoife or any user that isn't David, I will only be able to view and comment on the post.

As shown below - the option to edit or delete is not available to me:
